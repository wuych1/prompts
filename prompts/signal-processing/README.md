# Signal Processing

Prompts for designing filters, analyzing signals, and working with communications systems.

## Prompts in this Category

### [Design Digital Filter](design-digital-filter.md)
Design and analyze digital filters using modern MATLAB APIs with minimal specs. Includes numerically stable implementations, streaming support, and Filter Analyzer integration.

**Tags:** `matlab` `signal-processing` `filter-design` `iir` `fir` `sos` `lowpass` `highpass` `bandpass` `bandstop` `designfilt` `sosfilt` `ctffilt` `filtfilt` `filterAnalyzer`

**Release:** R2024b+ (recommended for CTF); Earlier releases can use SOS

### [Analyze Signal Spectrum](analyze-signal-spectrum.md)
Perform frequency-domain analysis with MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox using nonparametric spectral estimators and helper measurements. Includes PSD estimation (pspectrum, pwelch, pmtm), peak/band analysis, and two-signal workflows (coherence, transfer functions).

**Tags:** `matlab` `signal-processing` `spectral-estimation` `psd` `pspectrum` `pwelch` `pmtm` `periodogram` `spectrogram` `cpsd` `coherence` `transfer-function`

**Release:** Requires Signal Processing Toolbox (most functions). Some examples also reference DSP System Toolbox
